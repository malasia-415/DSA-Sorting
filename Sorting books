Imagine that I gave you 20 books to sort in alphabetical order. 
Express this as an algorithm and then implement your algorithm.

When dividing these books up I would seperate all a's, b's, c's, d's, e's, f's, g's,etc. Then I would sort them by last name
of author, that's if they would wanted sorted that way or not.
